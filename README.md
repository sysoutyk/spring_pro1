#project's title - mw ('merry wedding')

# description
The project is created by a group of people who wanted to practice their skills in spring. 
This project is designed to provide helpful resources for couples who are starting to plan thier weddings. 
Wedding industry is one of the fast growing industry over the half century. 
Although wedding is meant to be a personal celeboratory space where the bride and groom are communally celebrated by their loved one for their new journey ahead together. 
Yet, its original purpose is often forgotten and is disrupted by heavy to-do list on preparations. 
That's why mw is created. By concentrating resources from wedding hall research to sending invites at one spot, we hope that wedding prep can be done more efficiently and easily.
So then, couples will be able to enjoy thier anticipation for the D-day.
